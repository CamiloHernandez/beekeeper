<!-- ABOUT -->  
## About  
**This project is not yet production-ready. Breaking changes could be made.**  
  
Beekeeper is a batteries-included cluster computing solution written in Go. Make a homemade cluster with your old computers or an enterprise-grade deployment quickly and painless.  
  
The idea behind Beekeeper is simple: Take a bunch of computers and make them work together for a faster and more reliable system (yay, teamwork!).  
  
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->  
## Installation  
Beekeeper is split into two installs. The library is used to create new jobs and distribute them among the nodes while the CLI tools will help you get your nodes up and running.  
  
### Installing the Go library  
To install the Go library run the following command in the command line:  
```bash  
go get github.com/CamiloHernandez/beekeeper/lib  
```  
  
### Installing the CLI tool  
The command-line tool can be installed using go get as follows:  
```bash  
go get github.com/CamiloHernandez/beekeeper/bee  
```  
  
<!-- Usage -->  
## Usage  
  
**Drop by our [Quickstart page](https://beekeeper.dev/documentation/quickstart) for an in-depth onboarding!**  
  
### Starting a Node  
To run a node type`bee start` into the command prompt. The node will now listen for incoming tasks and execute them as they come in.
  
### Creating a Job  
To create a new Job we need to define a function implementing the `func (*beekeeper.Task)` prototype. The Task struct will hold the information needed to run the Job, such as additional data and returns.  
  
As an example we'll cluster a job that finds a bunch of primes numbers and returns them to the primary node:  
```go 
func RandomPrime(t *beekeeper.Task) {  
	 var primes []int64  
	 for len(primes) < 10000 { n := rand.Int63n(10000000000000000)  
		 if isPrime(n) { 
			primes = append(primes, n)
		 } 
	}  
	t.Returns["primes"] = primes
 }
```  
  
### Running a Task  
To run a task we first need a server to handle it. A server can be created with the `NewServer` function, and it can then be started with the `Start` method. This is blocking, so we'll run it inside a goroutine.  
```go  
go func() {  
 sv := beekeeper.NewServer()   
 err := sv.Start()    
   if err != nil{    
      panic(err)    
    } 
}()

defer sv.Stop()
```  
Now we need a list of the available nodes in our network. To do this we use `Scan`. Optionally we can specify an address to connect to using the `Connect` method. 
```go  
nodes, err := beekeeper.Scan(beekeeper.DefaultScanTime) 
if err != nil{    
   panic(err)  
}  
```  
`nodes` will be a slice containing the workers available in the local network. Before we can run the task we need to distribute it among the nodes.  
```go  
err = sv.DistributeJob("github.com/user/myFirstCluster", "RandomPrime", nodes...) 
if err != nil{    
   panic(err)  
}  
```  
All is left to do is create a new Task and send it to the workers. Since we are not going to send any arguments we'll use an empty Task. We can call `Execute` over every node, but for convenience, we have the `ExecuteMany` method at hand.
```go  
task := beekeeper.NewTask()  
  
results, err := sv.ExecuteMany(nodes, task) 
if err != nil{    
    panic(err) 
}  
```  
The execution will now block until all nodes have finished their task. Afterwards we iterate over the results and print the.  
```go  
var primes []int64 for _, result := range results{    
   print(result.Task.Returns["primes"].[]int64)  
}  
```
